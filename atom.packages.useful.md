# Useful Packages for Atom
## Overview 

## Installing Packages from the Command Line
To install 

## Languages

language-latex
language-markdown - community version of markdown language, a must have - but note that will mess up packages which depend on the core github markdown language. Not a biggie, but keep in mind if something old that uses it stops working.
language-r
language-vbscript

## Productivity

Zen - fullscreen, no borders or mess. Just write.
autocomplete-plus - autocomplete almost everything more intelligently than base package
date - assign a keybind to print a date in any form you want September 05 16
fonts - a bunch of monospace fonts (I use hack)
minimap - maybe a turn on/off for project one, but shows a map of the document. Useful for navigating long code
open-recent - a list of recently opened projects and files
pdf-view - view PDFs from within atom, super handy.
pigments - python highlighting improved
python-indent - automatically do pep8 whitespace in python
nvatom - the note taking tool I showed you. I bind to F5 for new note. Does require a bit of hacking to get working optimally as Korean package maintainer is lazy.

## Markdown Essentials

autocomplete-bibtex - setup to autocomplete bibtex citations. Good for quick notes.
figlet - convert any text to ascii art

language-markdown - as above
markdown-preview-plus - instantly preview markdown
